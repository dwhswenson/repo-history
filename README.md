# Repository history tracking

Phases 1–2 provide an in-memory monthly report contract and a synchronous GitHub
GraphQL foundation with authentication, pagination, and repository/head lookup.
Activity collection, report file writing, CLI, and backfill are planned in later
phases; see [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

Requires Python 3.12+. Packaging and Pixi configuration are maintained together in
`pyproject.toml`. Install with `pip install .`, or use the existing Pixi workspace:

```text
pixi run -e dev test
pixi run -e dev coverage
pixi run -e dev lint
pixi run -e dev format-check
pixi run -e dev build
```

Test suites mirror source module names with a `test_` prefix: for example,
`tests/test_queries.py` tests
`src/repo_history_tracking/queries.py`. Shared fixtures and response builders live
in `tests/conftest.py` and `tests/helpers.py`; `tests/test_packaging.py` covers
distribution integration. Pytest uses standard test filename discovery under
`tests`, with importlib mode.

## GitHub GraphQL foundation

Set `GH_TOKEN` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN` as a fallback), or pass an explicit token.
Blank environment values are ignored; an explicit blank token is an error.
The client supports repositories on GitHub.com accessible to that credential.

```python
from repo_history_tracking import GraphQLClient, lookup_repository

with GraphQLClient() as client:
    repository = lookup_repository(client, "example", "project")
    print(repository.repository_node_id, repository.default_branch_head)
```

The immutable `RepositorySnapshot` contains `repository_node_id`, current
`repository_full_name` and `repository_url`, `issues_enabled`, `default_branch`,
and `default_branch_head`. Empty repositories have null branch/head. This lookup
captures the head for later history traversal; it does not collect activities.
The client owns its session: use a context manager or call `close()`. It is intended
for sequential queries and must not be shared between concurrent workers.

`execute(document, variables, *, operation_name)` returns the checked GraphQL
`data` dictionary. Supply named **query** operations, not mutations. Values remain
in the variables payload. HTTP errors, malformed responses, and all nonempty
GraphQL error lists prevent success, including responses carrying partial data.

`iter_connection` traverses one forward `nodes` connection:

```python
query = """
query RepositoryIssues($owner: String!, $name: String!, $first: Int!, $after: String) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
    issues(first: $first, after: $after) {
      nodes { id }
      pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
    }
  }
}
"""
with GraphQLClient() as client:
    nodes = list(
        client.iter_connection(
            query,
            {"owner": "example", "name": "project"},
            operation_name="RepositoryIssues",
            connection_path=("repository", "issues"),
            page_size=100,
        )
    )
```

Each iterator owns its cursor and effective page size, including nested traversals.
`cursor_variable` and `page_size_variable` default to `after` and `first`; provided
variables can contain an initial cursor. Null nodes are preserved. Every page is
validated before yielding, but a later page can still fail: discard the entire
incomplete collection, including previously yielded nodes. Pagination performs
no date filtering or activity normalization.

Defaults are four attempts per operation/page, 1/2/4-second retry backoff, and
10-second connect/60-second read timeouts. Override `max_attempts` and `timeout`
on the client. Timeouts are Requests connect/read limits, not a total run deadline.
Connection failures and transient server errors are retried. Server query timeouts
and recognized resource errors halve paginated page sizes at the same cursor,
retaining the reduced size after success. Reductions share the attempt budget;
an unrecoverable size-1 failure stops immediately.

Rate limits always raise `RateLimitError` immediately without waiting or retrying.
Its `retry_after` (seconds) and `reset_at` (aware UTC datetime) are nullable when
GitHub provides no usable guidance. Callers must honor both before arranging a
later run. A successful response with zero remaining budget is returned, but the
client refuses further requests until its known reset; without one, use a fresh
client for a later run. A rejected rate-limited request also blocks further calls
on that client until its known reset, or requires a fresh client if unknown.

All API failures inherit `GitHubAPIError`: `AuthenticationError`, `TransportError`,
`GraphQLError`, `RateLimitError`, `PaginationError`, `RepositoryUnavailableError`,
and `QueryResourceError` (also a `GraphQLError`). Exceptions expose applicable
`operation`, `status`, `request_id`, `attempts`, `retry_after`, and `reset_at` fields.
Unavailable repositories are not distinguished as missing versus inaccessible.
Standard Python logging records retry/page-reduction information at INFO and
response status/request-ID/budget metadata at DEBUG. The package configures no
handlers and excludes credentials, query variables, and response bodies.

## Python API

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from repo_history_tracking import ReportMetadata, build_report, report_to_json

metadata = ReportMetadata(
    repository_node_id="R_example",
    repository_full_name="example/project",
    repository_url="https://github.com/example/project",
    month="2024-02",
    month_start=datetime(2024, 2, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    month_end=datetime(2024, 3, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    collection_started_at=datetime(2024, 3, 2, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    collection_finished_at=datetime(2024, 3, 2, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    ongoing=False,
    default_branch=None,
    default_branch_head=None,
)
report = build_report(metadata, actors=[], activities=[])
text = report_to_json(report)
```

The package exports all report dataclasses, `build_report`, `validate_report`,
`report_to_json`, `report_from_json`, `load_schema`, `derive_summaries`,
`git_identity_key`, and `unresolved_git_actor`. Contract violations raise
`ReportValidationError` with a field/record `path` and explanatory message.
Dataclasses are frozen records; construction alone does not validate them.
Build/validate/serialization operations enforce the contract. Nested summary
mappings are ordinary dictionaries; revalidate a report after modifying them.

## JSON contract version 1

The authoritative Draft 2020-12 schema is packaged at
`repo_history_tracking/schemas/monthly-report-v1.json` and available via
`load_schema()`. JSON has five required sections: `schema_version` (`"1"`),
`metadata`, `actors`, `activities`, and `summaries`. Unknown structural fields,
activity types, roles, and versions are rejected. GitHub reason/state strings and
nulls remain representable. Schema versioning is independent of package versioning.

Metadata records repository node ID/current name/URL, UTC month boundaries,
collection interval, ongoing flag, captured branch/head, and coverage limitations.
The ongoing flag and future-month rejection use collection start rather than the
reader's clock. Null branch/head denotes an empty repository. Event occurrence
must lie in `[month_start, month_end)`; contextual timestamps may be outside it.
Aware Python datetimes normalize to UTC `Z`; naive datetimes are invalid.

Each activity has `id`, `type`, `occurred_at`, nullable `url`, a `subject`,
`credits`, and type-specific `metadata`. Types are `commit`, `pr_opened`,
`pr_merged`, `issue_opened`, `issue_closed`, `issue_reopened`, `issue_comment`,
`pr_conversation_comment`, `pr_inline_review_comment`, and `pr_review`.
Node-backed IDs are `<type>:<source_node_id>`; commit IDs are
`commit:<repository_node_id>:<sha>`. Commits use committed time as occurrence and
retain authored time, parents, and committer metadata. Their title is the first
line of the commit message. Subjects retain current titles, URLs, node IDs,
issue/PR numbers, and author references. Bodies and full messages are excluded.

Credit entries contain nullable `actor_key` and `role`. Commits accept `author`
and `co_author`; merges, closures, and reopenings use `merger`, `closer`, and
`reopener`; other events use `author`. Missing performers remain null rather
than becoming a shared actor. The builder deduplicates actor/role pairs and sorts
records; deserialization rejects duplicates and inconsistent supplied summaries.
Serialization sorts actors by key, activities by occurrence/ID, credits by
actor/role, and object keys, using two-space indentation and a final newline.

Submitted reviews retain fetched state (including dismissal); pending reviews
are invalid. Inline comments record creation/publication time, review/thread
references, resolved/outdated flags, publication confirmation, and fallback flag.
Without publication time they must confirm publication and explicitly use
creation time as fallback. Closure reasons are nullable source values, never the
issue's current reason. Every closure/reopening has a separate event ID.

## Identity and counting

Linked humans and explicitly identified bots use GitHub node IDs as keys; logins
are mutable metadata. Supply bot classification only with explicit source
evidence: names do not establish bot status. Unresolved Git identities use
`git:email:<sha256>` of trimmed casefolded email, falling back to
`git:name:<sha256>` of trimmed case-preserved name. Original names/emails are
retained. No usable email/name yields null. These estimates may merge distinct
people or split one person's participation; no GitHub matches are inferred.

Repository counts count events once. Per-actor counts count each distinct
credited actor once per event, even with multiple roles. Committers and subject
authors are context unless independently credited. Counts contain all ten types,
including zeros. `distinct_actors` and `distinct_actors_by_type` count only credited
actors, divided into `total`, `human`, `bot`, and `unresolved_git`.
`actor_counts` contains only credited actors. `unattributed_total` and
`unattributed_by_type` count events with no known credited actor; a known author
plus a null co-author remains attributed. Actors referenced only as context may
appear in the registry but never inflate participation counts. No cumulative
counts are stored.

## Reconstruction limitations

Deleted comments, inaccessible items, removed commits, and transferred issues
can limit reconstruction. Repository/actor node IDs survive renames, but historical
display names are not reconstructed. Titles, resolved/outdated thread flags, and
review states reflect collection-time metadata. Captured-head history does not
establish when a commit reached the branch. Force-pushes, rebases, changed default
branches, and newly available data can revise rerun results. Collection is not a
transactional snapshot; concurrent changes may appear on a later rerun.
Disabled issues do not prevent later PR collection. Record applicable limitations
in `metadata.coverage_limitations`.
